### RUN

1. Though I create a .jar file, it does not run successfully;

2. Therefore, it would be better to run **Hungarian_DFS/src/Hungarian.java**   or **Humgarian_Array/src/Hungarian_Input.java** directly;

3. I use Intellij Idea 2017.03 while I think other IDE or terminal can run this file too with Java 9.0;

4. If you use IDE to run the file, you need to input the file path and name after the hint. e.g. You can input following file path to run test data: 

   â€‹						data\test0.txt 

   

### Data

1. test input: data\test0.txt  
2. test output: test0_hungarian_DFS.txt
