# README  

It's the final project for this course. BTW I like this course and professor very much though I did not do a good job in the final test I think. And I'm really really really busy recently with lots of projects, homeworks and things before go USA.  

What I do basically is to find out the maximum matching for unweighted bipartite graph and I read the src code from Amir Bawab (https://github.com/amirbawab) about Hungarian Algorithm to find out the best matching for completed graph.  

Really thanks for those two repositories:

### RUN

1. Though I create a .jar file, it does not run successfully;

2. Therefore, it would be better to run **Hungarian_DFS/src/Hungarian.java**   or **Humgarian_Array/src/Hungarian_Input.java** directly;

3. I use Intellij Idea 2017.03 while I think other IDE or terminal can run this file too with Java 9.0;

4. If you use IDE to run the file, you need to input the file path and name after the hint. e.g. You can input following file path to run test data: 

   â€‹						data\test0.txt 

   

### Data

1. test input: data\test0.txt  
2. test output: test0_hungarian_DFS.txt
